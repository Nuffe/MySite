### MySite
#### Project where i can practice different things
Gonna be a project where i can try and make things on my own, when i get the time and feel

Thoughts:
- A website interface
    - Got some ideas for persunal use (save book chapter infomation)
- Hosted on rasbery pi 4
- connect with Tailscale
- some kind of database, some SQL https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/ 
- Lets try and follow all the steps, design decisions (architecure, model it, and the like...)
- What language?
- Docker
- Connect the other APIs i use on docker to the site
-
